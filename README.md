# Coding-with-Carla---HTML-CSS
CWC - HTML and CSS files.

### You can clone or download these files to your account or desktop. This will include the full html file as well as the images we will be using along the way.

### In the next course we will look at CSS to style this markup and make it look nice!

Thanks for hanging out with me on Coding with Carla!
